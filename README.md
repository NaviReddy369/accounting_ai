# AI-Powered Financial Forecasting for Banking Institutions 🏦💹

![Financial Forecasting Demo](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400.png?text=Actual+vs+Predicted+Earnings+Visualization)

An advanced AI system for predicting corporate financial health, specifically designed for banking risk analysis and accounting automation. Leverages machine learning to forecast total assets and detect financial anomalies.

## 🚀 Key Features for Banking Applications
- **Predictive Asset Forecasting**: ML models project future total assets with 41% accuracy (R² 0.409)
- **Restatement Risk Detection**: Identifies financial restatements impacting asset valuations
- **Regulatory Compliance Support**: Flags potential misstatements for BASEL III/IFRS 9 compliance
- **Automated Financial Health Scoring**: Generates AI-driven corporate viability assessments
- **Three Model Architectures**: 
  - Gradient Boosting (Best Performance)
  - Random Forest (Feature Importance Analysis)
  - Linear Regression (Baseline Model)

## 📊 Performance Comparison
